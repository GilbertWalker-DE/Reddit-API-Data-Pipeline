# Reddit API Data Pipeline Project  
üöÄ Beginner-to-Pro Journey | Reddit ETL Pipeline with AWS & Power BI

**Status:** ‚úÖ Completed

---

## Overview

This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end data pipeline for extracting, transforming, and loading data from Reddit using the Reddit API.  
The dataset is stored in AWS Redshift and visualized in Power BI to analyze Reddit activity trends and engagement insights.

> **Note:** This was my **first data engineering project**.  
> I followed [ABZ-Aaron‚Äôs Reddit API Pipeline tutorial](https://github.com/ABZ-Aaron/reddit-api-pipeline/tree/master/instructions) as a learning guide, implementing the walkthrough code and adapting it to deepen my understanding of ETL pipelines, AWS services, and data visualization.  
> This was also my **first experience using Power BI**, where I successfully built and connected my own dashboard.

## Technologies Used

- **Python** ‚Äì for data extraction and ETL (requests, pandas, boto3)
- **Reddit API (PRAW)** ‚Äì to collect posts and comments
- **AWS Services:**
  - **S3** ‚Äì raw and processed data storage
  - **Redshift** ‚Äì data warehouse for analytics
  - **IAM** ‚Äì credential and access management
- **dbt Cloud** ‚Äì for online SQL-based data transformations
- **Airflow (Docker)** ‚Äì for ETL orchestration and automation
- **Power BI** ‚Äì for visualization and reporting
- **Terraform** ‚Äì infrastructure as code (reference)
- **Git/GitHub** ‚Äì for version control and documentation

## Setup Overview

1. Clone this repository to your local environment.  
2. Install dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.  
3. Configure Reddit API credentials in a local configuration file.  
4. Set up AWS resources (S3, Redshift, IAM) and connect via `boto3`.  
5. Run Python ETL scripts to extract and load Reddit data.  
6. Perform transformations using dbt Cloud.  
7. Connect Power BI to Redshift and build reports from the dataset.
